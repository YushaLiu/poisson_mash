Welcome to my research website.

## Application to a subset of the cytokines dataset
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects.html) to see how to fit poisson mash with random effects to a subset of cytokines data. <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_only_examples.html) to see some examples of genes that are identified to be differentially expressed across treatments by poisson mash with random effects, but not mash. <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_and_mash_random_effects_examples.html) to see some examples of genes that are identified to be differentially expressed across treatments by both poisson mash and mash. <br/>
Click on this [link](mash_only_examples.html) to see some examples of genes that are identified to be differentially expressed across treatments by mash only.



## Application to a subset of the cytokines dataset (updated analysis)
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_updated.html) to see how to fit poisson mash with random effects to a subset of cytokines data. <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_only_examples_updated.html) to see some examples of genes that are identified to be differentially expressed across treatments by poisson mash with random effects, but not mash. <br/>
Click on this [link](mash_only_examples_updated.html) to see some examples of genes that are identified to be differentially expressed across treatments by fixed effects-based mash only.



## Application to simulated data
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_sim_null.html) to see results based on single cell data simulated under the null. <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_sim_null_random_effects.html) to see results based on single cell data simulated under the null with random effects added by thinning. <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_sim_non_null.html) to see results based on single cell data simulated with both fixed and random effects added by thinning. <br/>
