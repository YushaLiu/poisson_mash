Welcome to my research website.

## Application to a subset of the cytokines dataset
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects.html) to see how to fit poisson mash with random effects to a subset of cytokines data. <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_only_examples.html) to see some examples of genes that are identified to be differentially expressed across treatments by poisson mash with random effects, but not mash. <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_and_mash_random_effects_examples.html) to see some examples of genes that are identified to be differentially expressed across treatments by both poisson mash and mash.


## Application to simulated data
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_sim_null.html) to see results to single cell data simulated under the null. <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_sim_non_null_v1.html) to see results to single cell data simulated with signal by thinning (setting 1). <br/>
Click on this [link](pois_mash_random_effects_sim_non_null_v2.html) to see results to single cell data simulated with signal by thinning (setting 2).
